/**
 * A general function to order things in a Loose Round Robin way. The simplist use of this
 * function would be to implement a loose RR scheduler between all the warps assigned to this core.
 * A more sophisticated usage would be to order a set of "fetch groups" in a RR fashion.
 * In the first case, the templated class variable would be a simple unsigned int representing the
 * warp_id.  In the 2lvl case, T could be a struct or a list representing a set of warp_ids.
 * @param result_list: The resultant list the caller wants returned.  This list is cleared and then populated
 *                     in a loose round robin way
 * @param input_list: The list of things that should be put into the result_list. For a simple scheduler
 *                    this can simply be the m_supervised_warps list.
 * @param last_issued_from_input:  An iterator pointing the last member in the input_list that issued.
 *                                 Since this function orders in a RR fashion, the object pointed
 *                                 to by this iterator will be last in the prioritization list
 * @param num_warps_to_add: The number of warps you want the scheudler to pick between this cycle.
 *                          Normally, this will be all the warps availible on the core, i.e.
 *                          m_supervised_warps.size(). However, a more sophisticated scheduler may wish to
 *                          limit this number. If the number if < m_supervised_warps.size(), then only
 *                          the warps with highest RR priority will be placed in the result_list.

/**
 * A general function to order things in an priority-based way.
 * The core usage of the function is similar to order_lrr.
 * The explanation of the additional parameters (beyond order_lrr) explains the further extensions.
 * @param ordering: An enum that determines how the age function will be treated in prioritization
 *                  see the definition of OrderingType.
 * @param priority_function: This function is used to sort the input_list.  It is passed to stl::sort as
 *                           the sorting fucntion. So, if you wanted to sort a list of integer warp_ids
 *                           with the oldest warps having the most priority, then the priority_function
 *                           would compare the age of the two warps.
