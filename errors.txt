The following errors are occuring in the tejas:-


1) since the DRAM was taken from the single core TEJAS, the global clock was same as the local clock. In the case of GPUTEJAS, each Simulation Multiprocessor (SM)
   has a local clock.Thus we need to see the clock synchronization and the working of the global clock;
	what i feel is, the SM that are/is currently using the DRAM, will be the most crucial ones. Their clock should be used in place of the global clock.
	Now discuss how many SM can simultaneously access the DRAM.



2)  In the System config, i have added the memory controller to use option, because we used the memory DRAM of the TEJAS in the GPUTEJAS. Please discuss furthure

// currently the following issue exists with the mainmemorydramcontroller

The CORES in the GPUTEJAS we have the TPC--> SM--->SP(this is a core) 
while in 
CPUTEJAS we directly have the CORES, and in the main memory DRAM controller, there is one function "ONE CYCLE OPERATION" WHICH involve the 0th core in the CPUTEJAS,here we need to see whether we have to pass the 0th SM or something else.
