The following errors are occuring in the tejas:-


1) since the DRAM was taken from the single core TEJAS, the global clock was same as the local clock. In the case of GPUTEJAS, each Simulation Multiprocessor (SM)
   has a local clock.Thus we need to see the clock synchronization and the working of the global clock;
	what i feel is, the SM that are/is currently using the DRAM, will be the most crucial ones. Their clock should be used in place of the global clock.
	Now discuss how many SM can simultaneously access the DRAM.



2)  In the System config, i have added the memory controller to use option, because we used the memory DRAM of the TEJAS in the GPUTEJAS. Please discuss furthure




------------------------------------

Some things that need to be served and resolved


Global clock issue

Event in gpu is not same as the event in the cpu tejas.
So we need to see the constructor

Next we have to see the constructor of the architectural component.
